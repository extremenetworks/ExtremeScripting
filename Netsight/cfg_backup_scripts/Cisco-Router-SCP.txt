-- Cisco Router SCP
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Scripts for management of Cisco ISR routers. May work on ASRs too.
-- Mainly used and tested with Cisco ISR 4k. Tested against only a few ISR G2.
-- Not tested against other Cisco routers.
--
-- Script was tested via a low bandwidth high latency line (5 Mbit/s, 300ms)
-- Download reached only 125 kBit/s. It needed more than 16 hours.
-- But it was successful :-)
-- You should tweek time to run fw downloads and config archive jobs not at the same time.
-- Otherwise you'll get "Device Busy" messages in XMC operations list.
--
-- boot rom (rom-monitor) upgrade does only copy file and not install rom-mon update.
-- no way to exit script e.g. on error while verifying file integrity.
-- But command to update is included in comment below.
-- Command may not work on ASRs, since they have more route processors than R0.
-- Does not work on ISR G2 and older. Syntax different, since no route processor visible.
-- So please upgrade boot rom manually, before reloading router.
--
-- Timed reset is done by command "reload in <HHH:mm>".
-- Ciscoes reload at will only allow a restart tiume at the same day.
-- Reload in allows up to 999 hours delay. Works with EMC.
--   But a reload with more than 999 hours will not throw an error...
-- EMC shows only date/time selector for timed reset.
--   If you want to reload in e.g. 45 minutes,
--   you have to calculate time and date by yourself.
--
-- Be sure to configure DNS correctly on your routers! Add reverse PTRs to your DNS!
-- They will perform some forward/reverse lookups. These might take  too long.
-- This can break Archive operation. "@COMMANDDONE 20" deals with that, but still can be too short.
-- Setting it too high can cause other hickups.
-- If that cannot be solved, maybe its better to stick to ancient TFTP.
-- This script is also available with TFTP as transport protocol.
--
-- for debugging you can use following embedded event manager script:
--   event manager applet log-commands
--    event cli pattern ".*" sync no skip no
--    action 1.0 syslog msg "$_cli_msg"
-- This script will send all commands issued at vty to log/syslog.
-- This will include the commands, issued by Extreme Management Center, how they are seen by the router.
-- Caution!!!!! Do not change that script if you do not know Cisco EEM!
--   e.g. if set to "skip yes" above, this will drop all commands entered at CLI without executing them!
--     --> Time to reboot, if not saved to startup. Time to factory default if saved.
--         But saving will be difficult, since command is ignored ;-)     phew...
--
-- Example of a log entry:
--   002875: Jan  3 12:34:49.179 MET: %HA_EM-6-LOG: log-commands: show configuration
