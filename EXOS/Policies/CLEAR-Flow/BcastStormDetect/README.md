# Broadcast Storm Detect

## Description
This policy provides a CLEAR-Flow monitoring example that 
inspects received broadcast message packets to detect potential
broadcast storm attacks.  Both TCP and UDP broadcast packets are
counted and should the sum of these broadcast messages exceed 
100,000 in one second.  In this case, an SNMP trap is issued 
along with a syslog message to provide notification of a 
potential broadcast storm attack.
