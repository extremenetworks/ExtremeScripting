# Network Recon Detection

## Description
This policy provides a CLEAR-Flow monitoring example that
inspects the TCP flags on all received TCP packets to detect
potential TCP flag filtering attacks.  Should the number of TCP packets
with all TCP flags on (a method used to avoid security filters)
exceed 1000 in 1 second, then an SNMP trap is issued, and a message
indicating the situation is written to the syslog.
