# iSCSI Auto-provisioning

## Description
This simple script uses CLEAR-Flow to identify iSCSI traffic (port 3260),
assign it the right Quality of Service, and enable jumbo frames.
This pre-provisioned settings in a network allows iSCSI traffic to be
protected in a higher priority queue.


### Files
* [iscsi.pol](iscsi.pol)	-  The Example policy file
* [README.md](README.md)	-  This Readme


### Requirements
* 11.6.x and Newer for iscsi.pol standard
* Platform(s): Summit Series; BlackDiamond 8800, 8900-series, 8900-XL series, BlackDiamond BDX


### Example
In the below example the rule becomes true and CLEAR-Flow executes its actions
automatically.

```
<X650 Running CLEAR-FLow policy> (Rule becomes true)
<X650 Running CLEAR-FLow policy> (CLEAR-Flow takes configured actions
                                  (e.g. QoS Provision))
```


### Notes
