# IP SLA UPM example

## Description
This UPM script will run every 30 Seconds and mimic the function  of IP SLA.  The script checks the PreferredRoute and SecondaryRoute for connectivity and changed the default route based on connectivity.  If both routes are reachable it will program the default route of the PreferredRoute.

This script is meant to be an example of a possible scripting solution.  It has not been verified by Engineering. Performance can not be guaranteed. Customer use is at their own risk.
