# Automated FS Backup

## Description
Run automated back up on all scripts, including configuration, policy and
scripts. Benefits include a simple rollback and configuration history.

### Files
* [backup.xsf](backup.xsf) - Manual backup script
* [xbd.xsf](xbd.xsf) - The UPM triggered backup script
* [README.md](README.md) - This Readme

### Requirements
* Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM) 12.3.x or higher
* Platform(s): Any ExtremeXOS switch.
* TFTP Server: IPv4 TFTP Server that allows switch to write files

### Example
In the below example the x250e would upload all files on the switch and a
second file in the root of the tftp for use with the Interactive Recovery script.
```
<x250e running script>	(log entry of AAA.AuthPass triggers UPM)
<x250e running script>	(UPM Runs and uploads current config as c<serial>.cfg)
<x250e running script>	(UPM Recursively uploads all files)
```

### Notes

* This requires a TFTP Server with write privileges by the switch
* This requires a date structure in the TFTP directory. NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!

```   (e.g. /tftpboot/<year>/<mo>/<day> or /tftpboot/2010/04/27)```

### Updates
1.0 - ( Mar 2009) First Version of the script

1.1 - ( Apr 2010) Changes made to interact with other scripts

1.2 - ( Dec 2017) On backup.xsf: corrcetions to bad syntax, removal of redundant .cfg upload
