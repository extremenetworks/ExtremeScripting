# Firmware Version Check

## Description
Allows for automatic firmware version validation at bootup. When a switch boots,
this script matches the configured-firmware-version with the correct-firmware
setting.  If the configured-firmware setting is off, it is corrected with the
switch boot-up.

### Files
* [fwvc.xsf](fwvc.xsf) 	-  The Core Script
[README.md](README.md)	-  This Readme

### Requirements
* Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM) 12.3.x and Newer for fwvc.xsf standard
* Platform(s): Any ExtremeXOS switch.
* TFTP Server

###Example
In the below example the x650 switch would check its firmware version against
a pre-set supported version. If the incorrect version was detected upon boot,
this would be corrected and switch (if selected) would reboot itself.
```
<x650 loaded with autoexec.xsf> (switch examines correct firmware)
<x650 loaded with autoexec.xsf> (If incorrect downloads correct image)
<x650 loaded with autoexec.xsf> (Option to reboot switch)
```



### Notes

* This requires a TFTP server
* This requires pre-setting correct firmware version in the script
* For automation the script should be copied into a default.xsf and or an autoexec.xsf

### Updates
* 1.0 - (7 Feb 2010) First Version of the script
