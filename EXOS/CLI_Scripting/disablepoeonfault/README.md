# Disable PoE ports on fault

## Description
This script will set up two UPM profiles on an ExtremeXOS(TM) switch.

The first UPM profile will monitor the log for any ports entering a PoE fault state. When a port enters the fault state, PoE will be disabled on this port.

The second UPM profile will monitor the log for port link down events. When this occurs, the UPM profile will enable PoE on this port.

### Requirements
* Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM) 15.3 or higher
* Platform(s): Any ExtremeXOS switch with PoE support
* License: Edge or higher

## Example

## Notes

The intended use for this script is when using legacy inline-power. When this is enabled, the switch may attempt to deliver power to non-PoE devices. When this occurs, the port will often fault, and remain faulted until PoE is reset on the port. By running this script, the port will automatically have PoE disabled when it enters the fault state, and will re-enable PoE when the device on that port is disconnected.
