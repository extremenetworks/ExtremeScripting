# PoE Power Down Daily

##Description
This profile turns power off at a specific time of day to a list of
Power-over-Ethernet enabled ports.

This Power Conservation Profile is designed to ease the set-up of power
conservation practices in your Extreme Networks edge switches. By using the
pre-defined power conservation profile and modifying it for use in your
environment, you'll have the opportunity to save energy and reduce energy
related network operating costs.

Networks that utilize Power over Ethernet enabled Voice over IP solutions,
wireless access points or other Power over Ethernet enabled devices are the
key beneficiaries of the module.

This profile turns off power at a specific time of day to a list of
Power-over-Ethernet enabled ports.  The profile is intended for deployment
with Extreme Networks EPICenter management platform Universal Port applet.
