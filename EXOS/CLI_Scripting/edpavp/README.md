# Auto-VLAN Provision EDP

## Description
This script will auto-configure an edge switch based on the ports seen on the
uplink port. The script will initially show EDP to find the VLAN, VLAN ID and
port that will be connected to the uplink.  The script will then create a VLAN,
configure it with VLAN ID and add the port tagged or untagged as necessary.

### Files

* [avp.xsf](avp.xsf)         - The Core Script
* [README.md](README.md)	- This Readme
* [avpdefault.xsf](avpdefault.xsf)	- Auto-VLAN Provision Deployed as a default.xsf script and using UPM from a Script

### Requirements

* Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM) 12.3.x and Newer for avp.xsf standard
* Firmware: ExtremeXOS 12.4.x and Newer for avpdefault.xsf expanded
* Platform(s): Any ExtremeXOS switch. 


### Example
In the below example the x250e running the applet would automatically configure
its upliknk with VLAN: EDP_TEST with a tag of 2010.
```
<x250e running script>	 (sends edp query) ----> <x450a with VLAN: EDP_TEST TAG 2010>
<x450a with VLAN: EDP_TEST TAG 2010> (replies with EDP PDU) ---> <x250e running script>
<x250e running script> (Parses EDP output and configures switch)
```



### Notes

* This requires a unique VLAN on the EDP uplink port that a switch running this script can see.
* This version will only provision the first VLAN. Multiple VLANs are ignored.
* The avpdefault.xsf will need to be renamed to default.xsf for ExtremeXOS to to use it when a configuration file is not selected. For more information please see the ExtremeXOS Concepts guide.

### Updates
* 1.0 - (19 April 2010) First Version of the script
