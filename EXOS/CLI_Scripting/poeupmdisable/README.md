# PoE fault disable via UPM

## Description
This script sets up two UPM profiles. The first monitors the log for a PoE port entering the faulted state. When this occurs, the UPM profile disables inline-power to this port.

The second UPM profile monitors the log for link down events. When one occurs, the UPM profile re-enables inline-power on the port.

###Files
* [README.md](README.md)
* [poe_upm.xsf](poe_upm.xsf)


### Requirements
* Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM) 15.3 and newer
* Platform(s): ExtremeXOS(TM) based Extreme Networks switches with PoE support
* License: Edge or higher (for UPM support)


### Example

### Notes
This is intended for use when legacy inline-power is enabled. When this is enabled, non-PoE devices may have power delivered to them by the switch, leading to the port entering a fault state until PoE is reset on this port. This script will detect a device entering this state and disable PoE to that port. When the device connected is removed, the UPM script for link down will be triggered, re-enabling PoE to that port.
