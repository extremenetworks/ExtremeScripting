# Legacy SNMPv1v2

### Description
This script provides an example of SNMP V1/V2 configuration for
an ExtremeXOS(TM) switch.

This script is a simple example of how one might go about configuring
SNMP V1/V2 on an ExtremeXOS switch.  The script can be used to enable
or disable SNMP V1/V2 access.  The script shows how to specify the
optional name, location and contact information.  The SNMP V1/V2 trap
receivers can optionally be created and configured.  Lastly, tailored
read-write and read-only community strings can be configured and the
default read-write and read-only community strings can be deleted from
the switch.

Specifically, this example performs the following functions:

1. Configures SNMP V1/V2 switch name, location and contact information

2. Optionally creates trap receivers

3. Optionally creates tailored read-write and read-only community strings

4. Optionally deletes read-write and read-only community strings
