# Non-Stacking Configuration Converter
This tool converts a non stacking "show configuration" output to a stacking configuration for slot 1.

### Description
This script will convert non stacking configurations to stacking configurations for slot 1.  Every situation possible has **NOT** been tested, but it worked on the configurations tested in the example.

**Please review the configuration before loading the configuration on a switch**

### Files
* [The Core Python Script - non_stacking_config_convert.py](non_stacking_config_convert.py)
* [README.md](README.md)
* [Example input configuration] (example.txt)
* [Example output stacking configuration] (stack_example.txt)

### Requirements
Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM)
This script was tested on 16.1 and older.

### Features
* This Script can be run on EXOS or on a PC with python 2.7 installed. 
 

### How to use
* The script was made on python 2.7.  Make sure it's installed.
* Place the switch show configuration output into a file.
* place the configuration file in the same directory as the python script.
* The script will ask you for the configuration file name. (enter it)
* the script will create a new file with "stack_" in front of the original file name that has the new stacking configuration.
* Check over the new configuration file to make sure it's right.
* Create the stack
* When stack is created use the command "load script <script_name>" to load the configuration.
* Check for any errors when running the .xsf

## EXOS run example:
```
Switch.2 # save configuration as-script nonstack
Do you want to save configuration to script nonstack.xsf? (y/N) Yes
Saving configuration to script nonstack.xsf on master .... done!

Switch.3 # run script non_stacking_config_convert.py

Note: please only use the show configuration output for this script.
      Make sure the starting non stack configuration file is in the same folder as the python script

what is the non stacking configuration file name? nonstack.xsf

The new stacking configuration will be saved as /usr/local/cfg/stack_nonstack.xsf?
