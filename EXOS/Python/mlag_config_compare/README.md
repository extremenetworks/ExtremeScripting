# MLAG Config Compare

## Description
This script was made to assist in checking the MLAG configuration between two MLAG peers.  If you run this script on both mlag peers you can take the output of both scripts and run a compare/diff on the two outputs to make sure all vlan configuration is correct.

Note: This script does not support switches with two MLAG peers.
