====================================================
This Python script will do the following:
 - Anchor itself into the XOS switch Universal Port Manager (UPM)
   as an event handler responding to 'device-detect' and
   'device-undetect' events
 - Create an alias command 'fa-ztc' on the XOS switch to allow
   user to configure ZTC via command line

Ok to proceed (y/n) ?y

Please logout and log back in for alias 'fa-ztc' to be active
Then can use command 'fa-ztc' to configure ZTC bindings
To uninstall, use command 'run script fa-ztc.py uninstall'
