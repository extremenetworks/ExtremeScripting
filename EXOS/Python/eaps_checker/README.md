# check_eaps
This script runs from a server/PC with python installed and check the eaps config and status of one or more switches

### Description
This script will connect to every switch IP given in the file when used with -f or checks only 1 switch when used with -s.
It will check the eaps config if all vlans are added correctly to the ring ports and will also check if there are vlans added 
to the ring ports that are not protected by eaps that could possibly cause loops.
If the option --vpif is used it will check the vpif state for every Eaps master domain on the secondary port for domain vlans.

### Files
* [The Core Python Script - check_eaps.py](check_eaps.py)
* [README.md](README.md)


### Requirements
Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM)
Following pyhton libraries are needed (most standard included in python):
  import telnetlib
  import re
  import argparse
  import sys
  import paramiko
  
  Paramiko is for SSH connection to the switch. This only works with the latest version of paramiko, please update this to the latest.
  Using PIP the command would be pip install --upgrade paramiko

### Features
* This Script runs from a remote server/PC, tested with python 2.7.

### How to use
* Copy the script to your server/PC 
* run the script with options -s <switch IP> or -f <file>. The file should contain an IP address per line.
* Other options:
 -u <username> 
 -p <password>
 --ssh (Use SSH)
 --vpif (Check vpif state on Eaps master secondary port)
