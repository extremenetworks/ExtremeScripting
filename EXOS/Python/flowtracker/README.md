# Flowtracker
Flowtracker is an easy-to-use tool for applying ACL counters to troubleshoot packet loss and identify flows

## Description
Flowtracker was created to help with troubleshooting packet loss on Extreme Networks switches.
This script can only be executed on EXOS switches running 15.6 and newer.
It allows you to easily create dynamic ACL counters that count traffic that the user has selected to match on.
If the Flow_track ACL already exists, then the script will remove it for easy ACL changing.

### Files
* [flowtrack.py](flowtrack.py)
* [README.md](README.md)

### Requirements
ExtremeXOS 15.6+

### Features
* Source and/or Destination MAC address matching 48-bit mask only
* Source and/or Destination IP address matching 32-bit mask only
* Ingress and Egress ACL counter direction
* Apply ACL counter to a port group
* protocol icmp matching with `-p icmp` option
* ACL removal with `-r` option
* Allows for '-' or ':' delimited MAC addresses.
* Only supports static ACL and counter called "Flow_track"
* If the Flow_track ACL already exists,  the script will remove it for easy ACL changing.

## Example Commands
```
run script flowtrack.py -sm 11:11:11:11:11:11 -dm 11-11-11-11-11-11  -p icmp -i 22
run script flowtrack.py -dm 11-11-11-11-11-11 -i 22
run script flowtrack.py -dm 11-11-11-11-11-11 -i 22 -e
run script flowtrack.py -sip 4.4.4.4 -dip 2.2.2.2 -i 22
run script flowtrack.py -sip 4.4.4.4 -p icmp -i 22
run script flowtrack.py -dip 4.4.4.4 -p icmp -i 1-10,15
run script flowtrack.py -dip 4.4.4.4 -p icmp -i 1-10,15 -e
run script flowtrack.py -r
run script flowtrack.py -h
```

##### Command Help
```
X450G2-48p-10G4.55 # run script flowtrack.py -h

usage: flowtrack.py [-h] [-r] [-p [PROTOCOL]] [-sm [SOURCE_MAC]]
                    [-dm [DESTINATION_MAC]] [-sip [SOURCE_IP]]
                    [-dip [DESTINATION_IP]] [-i [INTERFACE]] [-e]

This program is used to create a dynamic acl to count L2 or L3 packets. The
ACL will not deny any traffic. If creating an L3 flow tracker use -i, -sip,
-dip arguments. If creating an L2 flow tracker use -i, -sm, -dm arguments.To
match on ICMP use '-p icmp'. For egress ACL use '-e'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r, --remove          removes all Flow_track ACLs from the switch
  -p [PROTOCOL], --protocol [PROTOCOL]
                        Protocol to match on. ("ICMP") only
  -sm [SOURCE_MAC], --source_mac [SOURCE_MAC]
                        Source MAC address
  -dm [DESTINATION_MAC], --destination_mac [DESTINATION_MAC]
                        Destination MAC address
  -sip [SOURCE_IP], --source_ip [SOURCE_IP]
                        Source IP address
  -dip [DESTINATION_IP], --destination_ip [DESTINATION_IP]
                        Destination IP address
  -i [INTERFACE], --interface [INTERFACE]
                        Switch Port number to apply the ACL counter
  -e, --egress          Make egress ACL (default: ingress)
```
