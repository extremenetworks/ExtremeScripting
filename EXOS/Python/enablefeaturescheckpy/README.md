# List Enabled Features

## Description
This Python script identifies the features enabled on a switch.  The list
of features is discovered by a series of if/then else statements and includes
most of the common features that may be enabled by a switch.  This list does
not include all possible features of a switch and may be modified to
include the unique features running on your network.
