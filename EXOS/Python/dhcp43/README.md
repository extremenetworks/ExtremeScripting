# dhcp43
dhcp43 is a script that will take generate the command needed to configure an EXOS switch's built in DHCP server to provide DHCP option 43 for EXOS ZTP automated config download.

## Description
[EXOS ZTP](http://documentation.extremenetworks.com/exos/exos_21_1/getting_started/c_zero-touch-provisioning.shtml) will automatically download config files (.cfg), scripts (.xsf or .py), policy files (.pol), EXOS images (.xos), or EXOS XMOD files (.xmod) from a TFTP server if the correct information is provided in option 43 of a DHCP offer. 

This script takes arguments of filenames or URLS, and optionally a server IP address and a VLAN. It then generates the correctly formatted DHCP option 43 to be used with the EXOS DHCP server.

If a VLAN is provided and the script is being executed on an EXOS switch, the script will configure the DHCP options on the specified VLAN. Otherwise, it will simply provide the command needed to make this configuration change (with the VLAN if provided and not running in EXOS).

### Files
* [dhcp43.py](dhcp43.py)
* [README.md](README.md)

### Requirements
ExtremeXOS 15.6+

### Usage
```
usage: dhcp43.py [-h] [-s SERVER_ADDRESS] [-v VLAN_NAME] files

This script will generate the hex needed to configure EXOS's built-in DHCP
server with option 43 for ZTP. It will also either provide the command to use,
or configure the option on the specified VLAN.

positional arguments:
  files                 File(s) to be downloaded. If the '-s' option is used,
                        this may be simply be a file name. If multiple files
                        are given, they should be separated by spaces. If the
                        '-s' option is not used, this should be a full URL.
                        (IE, tftp://192.168.1.10/config.xsf)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SERVER_ADDRESS, --server-address SERVER_ADDRESS
                        IP Address of TFTP server for sub-option 100. May be
                        omitted if a URL is used for sub-option 101.
  -v VLAN_NAME, --vlan-name VLAN_NAME
                        VLAN to configure option 43 on. If this is included,
                        the option 43 config will be added to the DHCP server
                        configuration on this switch for this VLAN. If not,
                        the config command will simply be printed.
```
