# Unsaved Config Diff

### Description
This script will compare the currently running config with the saved config, and show the changes.

**This script will clear the CLI dirty bit. The config is not saved.**

### Files
* [conf_diff.py](conf_diff.py)
* [README.md](README.md)


### Requirements
Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM)
 

### How to use
* ` run script conf_diff.py`
* Lines that start with '-' are lines that are present in the saved config, and have been deleted from the running config.
* Lines that start with '+' are lines that are not present in the saved config, and have been added to the running config.

## EXOS run example:
```
 * X450G2-48p-10G4.11 # run script conf_diff.py
Comparing configurations, please wait...

If line starts with '+', the command has been added since last save.
If line starts with '-', the command was present in the last save, and has been deleted.

Config changes:
+ disable port 1
Note that this script has cleared the CLI dirty bit. The configuration has not been saved.
