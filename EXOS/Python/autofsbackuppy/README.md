# Automated FS Backup

## Description

Run automated back up on all scripts, including configuration, policy and scripts. 
Benefits include a simple rollback and configuration history.

### Files
* [DailyBackup.py](DailyBackup.py)
* [README.md](README.md)

### Requirements
* Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM) 15.5.2 and Newer
* Platform(s): Any ExtremeXOS switch

## Examples
DailyBackup.py</br>
log entry of AAA.AuthPass triggers UPM</br>
UPM Runs and uploads current config as `c<serial>.cfg`</br>
UPM Recursively uploads all files

In the above example the x250e would upload all files on the switch and a second file 
in the root of the tftp for use with the Interactive Recovery script.

## Notes

The first time this script runs, it installs itself into UPM to be called once a day.
* This requires a TFTP Server with write privileges by the switch
* This requires a date structure in the TFTP directory
(e.g. `/tftpboot/<year>/<mo>/<day>` or `/tftpboot/2010/04/27`)
