# List Compressor

## Description
This script takes a string of numerical values and compresses them into a string of condensed numerical ranges

This script is actually a test/example container for the list_compress() function. EXOS outputs occasionally display
numerical ranges (i.e port numbers and VLAN IDs) inefficiently, consuming valuable screen space.
This list_compress() function will compress the list down to the most efficient string possible.  This allows a user (or script) 
to use the data more efficiently, particularly when inputing the data into a CLI command or parsing it for information within a script.

Notes:
- Slot/Chassis numbers are also supported.
- The underlying list_compress() function will accept both a string of numbers as well as a pythonic list of numbers

### Requirements
N/A

### Example

1. Execute a Command that presents a list of numbers that needs to be compressed
```
Slot-1 Switch.6 # show port 1:1 vid
         Untagged  
Port     /Tagged   VID(s)
-------- --------  ------------------------------------------------------------
1:1      Untagged  None
         Tagged    3019, 3020, 3021, 3022, 3023, 3025, 3026, 3027, 3029, 3030, 
                   3032, 3033, 3034, 3035, 3036, 3041, 3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 
                   3046, 3047, 3048, 3050, 3051, 3052
```
                   
2. Input the list into the script
```
Slot-1 Switch.7 # run script list_compress.py "3019, 3020, 3021, 3022, 3023, 3025, 3026, 3027, 3029, 3030, 3032, 3033, 3034, 3035, 3036, 3041, 3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 3046, 3047, 3048, 3050, 3051, 3052"
```
3. Output compressed list for easier use in the CLI
```
3019-3023, 3025-3027, 3029-3030, 3032-3036, 3041-3048, 3050-3052
```
