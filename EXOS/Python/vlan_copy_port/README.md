# Vlan copy port script
This tool needs to be run on an EXOS switch and will copy all vlans and vmans from one port to another.

### Description
This script will take the exact vlan config of 1 port and copy that to another port. After that it asks if the port where the vlans are copied from need to be cleaned (move)
