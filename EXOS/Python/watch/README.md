# Watch
Watch is a simple script that repeats a CLI command so that its output can be watched without having to constantly run the command

## Description
This will repeat a CLI command for a user defined number of times (-c) with a user defined interval between the commands (-i) seconds. 
Default Count: 3
Default Interval: 5 seconds

Optionally you can enable a diff of numerical values (-d) which will replace numerical values that have changed between command iterations with a "+" followed by the difference between the two values.

* [watch.py](watch.py)
* [README.md](README.md)

### Requirements
ExtremeXOS 15.6+

### Usage
run script watch.py [-h] [-c COUNT] [-i INTERVAL] [-d] command

### Example
```
run script watch.py -i 5 "show ospf neighbor"
```

### Notes
Note that any CLI commands must be enclosed in double quotes, due to how the EXOS CLI handles string arguments.
