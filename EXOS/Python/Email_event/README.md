# Email event script
This tool will send an email when a log event is logged. It runs on the switch.

### Description
This script works together with UPM. UPM will start the script once it reacts on an event log entry. That log entry can be any event.
Keep an eye on the amount of entries you want to email, in the end it is the CPU of the switch that will send mails and you dont want to overload the CPU with sending mails about log events you are not interested in.

**Please review the configuration before loading the configuration on a switch**

### Files
* [The Core Python Script - email.py](email.py)
* [README.md](README.md)


### Requirements
Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM)
This script was tested on 16.1.

### Features
* This Script runs on EXOS.
 

### How to use
* Copy the script to the switch
* Adjust in the script the following lines:

    myVirtualRouter = 2  <- Number of your virtual-router to reach SMTP server

    FromDomain = "@email.com"

    to = 'Your@email.com'

    smtp = 'Your SMTP server IP/DNS'

* Setup UPM together with EMS to start the script for an event.
* Create a log filter that matches your event log events you want to email.
* In this example it acts on link Up/Down events

```
create log filter PortUpDown
configure log filter PortUpDown add events vlan.msgs.portLinkStateUp 
configure log filter PortUpDown add events vlan.msgs.portLinkStateDown 
```

* Create the UPM profile that launches the python script with correct arguments

```
create upm profile EmailProfile
enable cli scripting
run script email $EVENT.LOG_PARAM_0 $EVENT.LOG_PARAM_1
```

* Create the log target for UPM and bind it to the logfilter

```
create log target upm EmailProfile
enable log target upm EmailProfile
configure log target upm EmailProfile filter PortUpDown severity Info
```

* Enable DNS by adding a name server.

```
configure dns-client add name-server <DNS IP> vr <Correct VR to reach DNS server>
```

* After that the switch will mail you when a link status change happens.
