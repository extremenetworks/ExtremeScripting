# MLAG Config Check

## Description
This script will check a switch's MLAG config to ensure that there is only one port in the ISC
vlan, all vlans added to MLAG port also exist on the ISC port, and that all MLAG and ISC ports 
are active (and added to the aggregator if in a LAG).  

If a VLAN is not present on the ISC an option to auto-correct the configuration is provided

The tool also now supports multi-peer MLAG

This does not ensure that the tagging on vlans matches across MLAG peers.

### Files
* [mlag_config_check.py](mlag_config_check.py)
* [mlag_chk_v1.lst](mlag_chk_v1.lst) - This file can be downloaded to the switch using the ```download url <url> <vr>``` command.
* [README.md](README.md)

### Requirements
* Firmware: ExtremeXOS(TM) 15.6+
* Platform(s): Any ExtremeXOS switch

### Example

Correct MLAG configuration:
```
 PEER_2.152 # run script mlag_config_check.py

>> Checking MLAG Configuration and Status...

>> Checking MLAG Peer "PEER_1"...
No problems found on peer "PEER_1"

>> Checking MLAG Peer "PEER_3"...
No problems found on peer "PEER_3"

>> MLAG config check completed.
```

Incorrect MLAG configuration:
```
* PEER_2.142 # run script mlag_config_check.py

>> Checking MLAG Configuration and Status...

>> Checking MLAG Peer "PEER_1"...
>> CONFIG ERROR: Port 2, a LAG member of the ISC for peer PEER_1, is down.  Please resolve.
>> CONFIG ERROR: MLAG port 6 for peer PEER_1 is down.  Please resolve.
>> CONFIG ERROR: VLAN VLAN_0100 is found on an MLAG port but not added to ISC port 1
>> CONFIG ERROR: VLAN VLAN_0200 is found on an MLAG port but not added to ISC port 1
>> Would you like to add the missing vlans to the ISC? (y/n)

>> Checking MLAG Peer "PEER_3"...
>> CONFIG ERROR: ISC for PEER_3 is not a LAG.  It is recommended that all ISC connections use link aggregation
>> CONFIG ERROR: ISC port 3 for Peer PEER_3 not active. Please resolve.

>> MLAG config check completed.
```
