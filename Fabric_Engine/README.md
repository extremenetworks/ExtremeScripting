# APIs for Fabric Engine

Fabric Engine (aka VOSS) provides two APIs: RESTconf and OpenAPI. The OpenAPI is a modern API with much better feature coverage, and it is strongly recommended to prefer OpenAPI over RESTconf. The API support was added as follows:

VOSS 8.0 &rarr; RESTconf 1.0<br>
VOSS 8.5 &rarr; RESTconf 2.0<br>
Fabric Engine 9.3.x &rarr; OpenAPI<br>

OpenAPI is a strategic API for Extreme Networks, because it is used by Extreme Platform One and is continuously expanded.
