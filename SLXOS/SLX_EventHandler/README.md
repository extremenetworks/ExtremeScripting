# SLX event-handler template

This is a template script for writing SLX event-handler scripts.

## Description

This script will register itself as an event-handler for the SLX. On the specified event, the SLX will pass the log message information to the script, and the script will do the requested actions.  

Please review the scripts actions prior to usage.

## Files

* [event_handler_template.py](event_handler_template.py) - This is a template file for the event handler script.

* [po_member.py](po_member.py) - This is an example based off the template that enables or disables the port-channel members based on the port-channel state change log message.

## Requirements

Firmware: Extreme SLX OS 17r.1.00 or later, or Extreme SLX OS 17s.1.00 or later.
VDX may work, but has not been tested.

## Features

This script must be run on a Extreme SLX platform.

## How to use

1. Modify the template script for the desired action  it should do, and log message and information it should trigger on.
2. Copy the script to the SLX device.
3. Execute 'python <filename_of_script.py> --register'
4. Verify that the script has registered as an event-handler by using 'show run event-handler'.
5. Wait for the script to be activated.
