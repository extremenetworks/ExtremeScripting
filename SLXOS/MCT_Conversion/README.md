# MCT configuration converter
Tool to aid in converting  Multi Chassis Trunk (MCT) CLIs in SLXOS 18r.2.00b to the new format as required by SLXOS 20.1.1.

# Description
MCT CLIs (Command Line Interface) are simplified in SLXOS 20.1.1.
When 'firmware download' command to upgrade to SLXOS 20.1.1 is executed on a system running SLXOS 18r.2.00b,
warning message will be shown indicating that MCT configuration in the system will be lost during upgrade. The warning would also indicate
that if user wants to preserve existing MCT configuration, the tool 'mct_config_convert.py' has to be run in 'exec' mode before upgrading to SLXOS 20.1.1.

The tool 'mct_config_convert.py' converts the MCT configuration present in SLXOS 18r.2.00b device's startup-config to the new format as needed by SLXOS 20.1.1. The tool needs to be copied to the 'flash' path on the device running SLXOS 18r.2.00b.
For example, below 'copy ' command can be run in 'exec' mode as shown below:

*sw# scp://\<username\>:\<password\>@hostname/\<file path of mct_config_convert.py\>  flash://*
