# Integrated Application Hosting (Insight VM) workflows
| Workflow name | Description | Version |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- |
|[Deploy Insight VM](xwf/Deploy_Insight_VM-22.6.12.11v95.xwf?raw=true) [(How-to-use)](xwf/Deploy-Insight-VM_How-to-use.pdf)|Workflow to deploy an IAH Insight VM on EXOS or VOSS capable switch. For EXOS it works on standalone switches and Stacks. This workflow is designed to be run manually, by selecting the switch and executing the workflow against it. The VM image must be already added to XIQ-SE Firmware under /tftpboot/firmware/images/ ( or as set in workflow variable const_XMC_IAH_IMAGE_PATH ). Note that files larger than 4096MB cannot be transferred using the web interface, in which case the image needs to be FTPed directly to XIQ-SE. The workflow takes care of transferring the VM image to the switch (FTP with VOSS and SCP with EXOS) unless the image, with the right size is already found to be on the switch, in which case the existing file is used to save time (the image transfer with FTP/SCP can take up to 15 minutes). The workflow inputs will determine which sideband port to use as well as CPU and memory resources to assign to the VM. This data is then used to install and start up the VM on the target switch. The workflow can be run on one or more switches at the same time. Input values for EXOS and VOSS will be somewhat different though these can be supplied as ${variable} where the relevant site of the switch will be used to obtain values for the variable.|22.6.12.11v95|
|[Upgrade FIGW](xwf/Upgrade_FIGW-22.6.12.11v41.xwf?raw=true) [(How-to-use)](xwf/Upgrade-FIGW_How-to-use.pdf)|Workflow to upgrade the FIGW VM on an Insight/IAH capable VSP7400/VSP4900/5720. The workflow will expect to already find a FIGW running on the target switch, and will simply back that up, delete it, re-deploy the new (or same) version of FIGW, then re-apply the config to the new FIGW. This workflow is designed to be run manually, by selecting the VSP and executing the workflow against it. Workflow can be run on multiple switches at the same time.|22.6.12.11v41|
