Onboard Mgmt VLAN

v23
	- First version shared
v26
	- Added ability to set the System Name at the same time
v28
	- When workflow run second time after re-add to same site, no completion message is displayed
	- Verification of re-add XIQ-SE was not erroring as expected
v29
	- Added MAC address as device lookup in CSV file
	- A rediscovery is triggered on the newly re-added device IP, to make sure the sysname change is
	  quickly refreshed on XIQ-SE
v59
	- Added ability to change the accpeted CSV delimiter character; this can now be set in the
	  new const_CSV_DELIMITER workflow variable
	- Workflow is now able also to set the mgmt VLAN IP even if the switch initially acquired an OOB IP
	- Workflow can now be run manually with static input values without providing any CSV file
	- XIQ-SE device nickname is now cleared after re-adding device to XIQ-SE
	- Auto-sense ISIS Hello auth key can now also be changed during the mgmt IP change
	- Site and CSV variable names can now include the "-" character
	- On completion workflow now triggers device config reload via XIQ-SE API
v60
	- Function to read CSV file now tolerates empty lines in CSV file as well as spaces before/after
	  commas/values are now stripped
v61
	- Increased const_DELAY_ISISAUTH_CHANGE to default 60 secs
	- Introduced a 10 sec delay const_DELAY_RECONNECT before attempting to reconnect to device after
	  site re-add
v62
	- XIQ-SE device nickname is now set to match the provided and switch configured sysname
v63
	- Increased const_PING_NEW_IP_TIMEOUT to 20secs
	- Configuration of sysname is now performed at the beginning, before changing the switch IP and
	  deleting and re-adding the switch to XIQ-SE; this way no issue with XIQ not updating the sysname
v66
	- Added optional input for additional CLI commands
	- Added variable const_NO_ERROR_ON_FAIL_SAVE which can be enabled to prevent workflow failing if
	  a final "save config" could not be performed on the switch
	- Added variable const_AGGRESSIVE_SAVE which can be enabled to kill other CLI sessions if unable
	  to perform save config
	- Updated to latest function versions
v68
	- Added input validation for workflow to execute to make sure it is in format '<folder>/<name>'
	- Additional CLI commands now only processes commands which are not commented out
	- Additional CLI commands can now process commands with // to feed passwords to interactive prompts
	- Additional CLI commands has commented out example of how to set EDM user passwords from there
v69
	- Now checks the sflow agent IP and if it is set to the old IP, it is now changed to new IP
	- Added ability to set the XIQ-SE Device Topology Role for the device
v70
	- Added ability to set device Asset Tag under device annotation
v72
	- Workflow was failing if Mgmt VLAN Default Gateway was not set; now it can handle that case, even
	  if an unlikely deployment option
	- Added workflow variable const_GRACEFUL_EXIT_IF_NO_SN; by default False; can be set to let the
	  workflow gracefully exit if the device lookup key was not found in the provided CSV file
	- Added workflow variable const_GRACEFUL_EXIT_IF_NO_IP; by default False; can be set to let the
	  workflow gracefully exit if no Mgmt VLAN IP value was obtained from Site or CSV inputs
v73
	- A check is now performed to see if there are any auto-sense ports in state NNI-ISIS-UP, and if not
	  the workflow aborts, as there is normally no chance for it to succeed; this check can be disabled
	  via const_AUTOSENSE_NNI_CHECK
	- Small corrections to error messages
	- Default const_DELAY_SITE_READD increased to 30sec
v74 - posted
	- When deleting the switch from XIQ-SE, if it was present under NAC, it is also removed there.
	  During this process the switch is deleted from all and any Location Groups; it was found that
	  if some of those Location Groups were named using unicode characters the workflow would fail with:
	  'ascii' codec can't encode character
	  The workflow is now modified to correctly handle unicode characters during that process
