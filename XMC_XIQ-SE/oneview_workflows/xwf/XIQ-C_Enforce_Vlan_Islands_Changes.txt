v39
	- First version
v43
	- Now also adds the roles using VLAN Islands to the same Device Group Profiles
	  where the VLAN topologies were added
v61 - posted
	- Completey new workflow with 3 activities, absorbs previous single activity workflow
	- Islands roles which have VLAN-id or I-SID set to None are now ignored
	- Added functionality where Police Role Rules of type "Wireless Controller" can now be
	  pushed by workflow onto corresponding XIQ-C Role; this gets around issue of certain
	  rules not being natively supported on XIQ-SE Policy for XIQ-C: (a) L3 FQDN rules,
	  (b) Egress any source rules, (c) HTTP/HTTPS redirect rules
