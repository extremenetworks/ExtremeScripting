Onboard Mgmt VOSS

v9
	- First version shared
v11
	- CSV data exported to follow on workflow is now exported as JSON using launch variable wrkfl_deviceJsonData
	- If a different site to re-add device to is given, this site is now used to resolve ${site-variables}
	- Added to variable const_EXPORT_EMC_VARS additional emc_vars key deviceNosId
v12
	- If an auto-sense ISIS Hello auth key is provided, the workflow now only proceeds if it sees auto-sense
	  interfaces in state NNI-AUTH-FAIL or (new check) if the switch has no ISIS adjacencies; otherwise it delays
	  execution up to expiry of const_NO_NNI_ISIS_AUTH_DELAY (default 300sec) as before
v13
	- CSV now also extracts the device's lookup (serial number or MAC address) to be used as $<> variable
v14
	- Added more logic to v11 change: if a different site to re-add device to is given, this site is now used
	  to resolve ${site-variables}
	  But, the initial site of the switch is still going to be used (instead of re-add site) if any of these
	  conditions are true:
	  1 - No re-add site input provided
	  2 - Re-add site input and/or CSV file input is provided but as a ${site-var} itself
	  3 - Re-add site input is provided but as a $<csv-var> but yields an empty value
	  4 - New workflow variable const_SITE_VAR_FORCE_INIT_SITE is set to true (by default it is false)
	- When calling a follow on workflow, the NBI call also specifies key wrkfl_deviceFamily and sets it to
	  the family type used by this workflow; this can facilitate the next workflow, e.g. Apply Config Template,
	  to set the correct family type, even if XIQ-SE does not yet have it set for the device
v15
	- Fixed bug in #elseif Cisco velocity type statement processing; the #elseif condition was never processed even if
	  the #elseif condition was true
v17 - posted
	- If an auto-sense ISIS Hello auth key is provided, the workflow now only proceeds if it sees auto-sense
	  interfaces in state NNI-AUTH-FAIL or if the switch has no ISIS adjacencies or (new check) it has SD-WAN ISIS
	  adjacencies; otherwise it delays execution up to expiry of const_NO_NNI_ISIS_AUTH_DELAY (default 300sec) as before
	- For mgmt VLAN IP change:
	  Check that new IP address subnet is different from initial IP subnet is no longer performed if an auto-sense ISIS
	  Hello auth key is provided, as it is possible to setup the core with "auto-sense onboarding i-sid X" where X is
	  not default 15999999, but the actual desired mgmt VLAN I-SID. Initially, while the switch has no ISIS Hello auth
	  key, the onboarding I-SID is presented, by the core switch, as an untagged binding on the uplink, and after this
	  workflow runs, and the switch gets the ISIS Hello auth key, it is able to bring up the NNI and then the new mgmt
	  IP address can be on the same I-SID with the same subnet
