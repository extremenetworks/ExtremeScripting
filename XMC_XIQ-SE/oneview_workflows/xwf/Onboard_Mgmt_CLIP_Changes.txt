v7
	- Added MAC address as device lookup in CSV file
	- A rediscovery is triggered on the newly re-added device IP, to make sure the sysname change is
	  quickly refreshed on XIQ-SE
v27
	- Added ability to change the accpeted CSV delimiter character; this can now be set in the
	  new const_CSV_DELIMITER workflow variable
	- Workflow is now able also to set the mgmt CLIP IP even if the switch initially acquired an OOB IP
	- Workflow can now be run manually with static input values without providing any CSV file
	- XIQ-SE device nickname is now cleared after re-adding device to XIQ-SE
	- Workflow is now also able to change the mgmt CLIP even if a mgmt CLIP was already configured
	- Auto-sense ISIS Hello auth key can now also be changed during the mgmt IP change
	- Site and CSV variable names can now include the "-" character
	- On completion workflow now triggers device config reload via XIQ-SE API

v33
	- Increased const_PING_NEW_IP_TIMEOUT to 20secs
	- Configuration of sysname is now performed at the beginning, before changing the switch IP and
	  deleting and re-adding the switch to XIQ-SE; this way no issue with XIQ not updating the sysname
v36 - posted
	- Added optional input for additional CLI commands
	- Added variable const_NO_ERROR_ON_FAIL_SAVE which can be enabled to prevent workflow failing if
	  a final "save config" could not be performed on the switch
