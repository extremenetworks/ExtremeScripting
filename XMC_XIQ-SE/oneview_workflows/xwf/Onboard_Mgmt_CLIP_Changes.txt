Onboard Mgmt CLIP

v5
	- First version shared
v6
	- When workflow run second time after re-add to same site, no completion message is displayed
	- Verification of re-add XIQ-SE was not erroring as expected
v7
	- Added MAC address as device lookup in CSV file
	- A rediscovery is triggered on the newly re-added device IP, to make sure the sysname change is
	  quickly refreshed on XIQ-SE
v27
	- Added ability to change the accpeted CSV delimiter character; this can now be set in the
	  new const_CSV_DELIMITER workflow variable
	- Workflow is now able also to set the mgmt CLIP IP even if the switch initially acquired an OOB IP
	- Workflow can now be run manually with static input values without providing any CSV file
	- XIQ-SE device nickname is now cleared after re-adding device to XIQ-SE
	- Workflow is now also able to change the mgmt CLIP even if a mgmt CLIP was already configured
	- Auto-sense ISIS Hello auth key can now also be changed during the mgmt IP change
	- Site and CSV variable names can now include the "-" character
	- On completion workflow now triggers device config reload via XIQ-SE API
v28
	- Function to read CSV file now tolerates empty lines in CSV file as well as spaces before/after
	  commas/values are now stripped
v30
	- Increased const_DELAY_ISISAUTH_CHANGE to default 60 secs
	- Introduced a 10 sec delay const_DELAY_RECONNECT before attempting to reconnect to device after
	  site re-add
v31
	- XIQ-SE device nickname is now set to match the provided and switch configured sysname
v32
	- Rollback of CLIP creation was not working if the newly created CLIP was not reachable by ping
v33
	- Increased const_PING_NEW_IP_TIMEOUT to 20secs
	- Configuration of sysname is now performed at the beginning, before changing the switch IP and
	  deleting and re-adding the switch to XIQ-SE; this way no issue with XIQ not updating the sysname
v36
	- Added optional input for additional CLI commands
	- Added variable const_NO_ERROR_ON_FAIL_SAVE which can be enabled to prevent workflow failing if
	  a final "save config" could not be performed on the switch
	- Added variable const_AGGRESSIVE_SAVE which can be enabled to kill other CLI sessions if unable
	  to perform save config
	- Updated to latest function versions
v38
	- Added input validation for workflow to execute to make sure it is in format '<folder>/<name>'
	- Additional CLI commands now only processes commands which are not commented out
	- Additional CLI commands can now process commands with // to feed passwords to interactive prompts
	- Additional CLI commands has commented out example of how to set EDM user passwords from there
v39
	- Now checks the sflow agent IP and if it is set to the old IP, it is now changed to new IP
	- Added ability to set the XIQ-SE Device Topology Role for the device
v40
	- Added ability to set device Asset Tag under device annotation
v44
	- Added workflow variable const_GRACEFUL_EXIT_IF_NO_SN; by default False; can be set to let the
	  workflow gracefully exit if the device lookup key was not found in the provided CSV file
	- Added workflow variable const_GRACEFUL_EXIT_IF_NO_IP; by default False; can be set to let the
	  workflow gracefully exit if no Mgmt CLIP IP value was obtained from Site or CSV inputs
	- Added logic for 5320-16 & 5320-24 models; if they are found to be SD-WAN enabled and they are
	  running 9.0.3.0 or later, the workflow will now activate: auto-sense sd-wan vrf GlobalRouter
v45
	- A check is now performed to see if there are any auto-sense ports in state NNI-ISIS-UP, and if not
	  the workflow aborts, as there is normally no chance for it to succeed; this check can be disabled
	  via const_AUTOSENSE_NNI_CHECK
	- Small corrections to error messages
	- Default const_DELAY_SITE_READD increased to 30sec
v46
	- When deleting the switch from XIQ-SE, if it was present under NAC, it is also removed there.
	  During this process the switch is deleted from all and any Location Groups; it was found that
	  if some of those Location Groups were named using unicode characters the workflow would fail with:
	  'ascii' codec can't encode character
	  The workflow is now modified to correctly handle unicode characters during that process
v47
	- Check for auto-sense ports in state NNI-ISIS-UP is now skipped if the workflow was provided with
	  an auto-sense ISIS Auth key
v50
	- Check for auto-sense ports in state NNI-ISIS-UP is now replaced with a check for ISIS adjacency up
	- Parsing of CLI commands was incorrectly stripping #error pragma commands
	- Cisco velocity type #if/#elseif/#else/#end statements are now allowed in additional CLI commands box
v53
	- CSV parsing code is now forgiving with invalid CSV files where an entry has less records than declared in the top row
	- Fixed bug on error messages which would only display if failing to delete the switch from XIQ-SE or Access Control
v56
	- Error messages in case of NBI mutations now display LastNbiError
	- Added variable const_EXPORT_EMC_VARS which can be populated with emc_vars keys to make available
	  in ${<varname>} variables, with special treatment of keys "deviceIP" & "deviceName" which will be
	  set to the target VLAN mgmt IP and System name; these variables can be used in the Additional
	  CLI commands input box
	- Sometimes emc_vars['deviceSoftwareVer'] is not available after ZTP+ onboarding; workflow now
	  gets version from switch directly if that happens instead of failing
	- Added variable const_FOLLOW_WORKFLOW_DELAY to be able to add a delay before calling follow on
	  workflow
v60
	- Added support for path variables %rootDir%, %sitePath% and %siteName% on CSV file input
	- Ability to parse #if/#elseif/#else/#end, #eval, #sleep, #last statements in additional CLI commands input
	- Timer const_DELAY_RECONNECT increased from 10 to 15sec
	- Workflow now can take a mgmt VRF L3VSN I-SID input, and is capable to create the mgmt VRF and L3 I-SID
v61
	- Workflow Mgmt CLIP VRF inupt can now take VRF name + optionally the VRF-id with syntax: <vrfname>:<vrfid>
v62
	- VRF IPVPN creation was not working when VRF and I-SID provided
	- If an auto-sense ISIS Hello auth key is provided, the workflow now only proceeds if it sees auto-sense
	  interfaces in state NNI-AUTH-FAIL, otherwise it delays execution up to expiry of const_NO_NNI_ISIS_AUTH_DELAY
	  (default 300sec); the NNI-AUTH-FAIL is new in VOSS 9.1.1.0, so this check & delay will only happen if the
	  switch software version is 9.1.1.0 or later; for earlier software versions nothing has changed, but setting
	  the ISIS auth key on them will remain best effort and typically will only work if the onboarding switch is
	  directly connected to the core/distribution; for fabric "stacks" 9.1.1.0 is required with above changes.
v63
	- Check above for NNI-AUTH-FAIL was happeneing on software verions before 9.1.1.0 instead of 9.1.1.0 or later
v64
	- Changed workflow so that it can take the data for the $<variables> not from a CSV file but directly from
	  either another activity added to the workflow, or by calling this workflow via NBI call. In both cases
	  the new workflow variable wrkfl_deviceJsonData just needs to be set in JSON format to the equivalent data
	  that is extracted from the CSV file; this is so that some customers can hook up the workflow directly with
	  their IPAM database instead of using a CSV file.
	- Python within activities is now versioned, since people are taking the Python code and using it within their
	  own, different workflows
	- Python within activities are now able to set their own const_xxx variables to defaults even if those variables
	  are not defined under workflow variables; for same reason, people are taking the Python code and using it within
	  their own, different workflows which may not have those variables set
	- CLI functions enhances so that failure to connect at first attempt no longer makes the entire workflow fail.
	  Now the CLI will retry by default 6 times at 10 sec intervals; so will only fail if no CLI connection can be
	  established after 1min and 10sec. Defaults can be changed with variables const_CLI_RETRIES and const_CLI_RETRY_DELAY
	- As of XIQ-SE 25.2, when deleting a switch from the database, XIQ-SE wants to connect to the switch to withdraw
	  the Pilot license, but if the switch is unreachable, then the delete process takes 5 minutes. The old logic
	  of this workflow was to change the mgmt IP on the switch, then delete the switch with its old IP from the site
	  and then re-add the same switch with the new IP. But this means that when the switch is being deleted, it is no
	  longer reachable by XIQ-SE. The new workflow logic is to first delete the switch from XIQ-SE + now wait for that
	  to complete, only then the mgmt IP on the switch is changed (as well as setting ISIS Auth key if applicable) and
	  then we wait for that IP to be reachable. If the IP is not reachable, then the switch is re-added to XIQ-SE
	  with its old IP (as the mgmt convert will rollback anyway) and the workflow aborts. Whereas if the new mgmt IP
	  is reachable, then the existing CLI session (on no longer existing IP) is closed; the workflow then proceeds
	  to delete the old IP from Access Control and all and any Access Control Location Groups, and after the site
	  re-add delay finally re-adds the switch with its new mgmt IP into XIQ-SE, in the same or desired site.
	  CLI connection is the re-established with the new mgmt IP, and the new mgmt IP is committed (so that it won't
	  rollback), if app-telemetry was configured, the sflow source IP is changed, and the rest of the custom CLI
	  commands is applied.
	- New variable 	const_WAIT_TIME_SITE_DELETE at default 120 sec, is max time to wait for device deletion from
	  XIQ-SE to complete
	- When updating the app-telemetry sflow config, a check is now made to make sure we are not on a 4220 with
	  basic CLI, and if so this config is skipped, as it is not possible to configure add-telemetry without the full
	  CLI; this however should not happen; even if the 4220 did not get a Plot license (it can take 24 hours worse
	  case), XIQ-SE should have created the special sitemanager credentials that give it full CLI access from
	  XIQ-SE scripts/workflows.
	- CSV data (file and index) can now be exported to follow on workflow
v65/1.02
	- const_WAIT_TIME_SITE_DELETE increased from 120 to 360 secs, as device deletion might take that long with
	  XIQ-SE 25.2 if the device in not reachable for any reason
	- In case of failure, if a Site to re-add was given, the workflows was re-adding there, instead of rolling back
	  to the original site
v68/1.03
	- Workflow was failing due to lack of check_autosense_nni_fail CLI command
v71/1.04
	- CSV data exported to follow on workflow is now exported as JSON using launch variable wrkfl_deviceJsonData
	- If a different site to re-add device to is given, this site is now used to resolve ${site-variables}
	- Added to variable const_EXPORT_EMC_VARS additional emc_vars key deviceNosId
v72/1.05
	- If an auto-sense ISIS Hello auth key is provided, the workflow now only proceeds if it sees auto-sense
	  interfaces in state NNI-AUTH-FAIL or (new check) if the switch has no ISIS adjacencies; otherwise it delays
	  execution up to expiry of const_NO_NNI_ISIS_AUTH_DELAY (default 300sec) as before
v73/1.06
	- CSV now also extracts the device's lookup (serial number or MAC address) to be used as $<> variable
v74/1.08 - posted
	- Added more logic to v71 change: if a different site to re-add device to is given, this site is now used
	  to resolve ${site-variables}
	  But, the initial site of the switch is still going to be used (instead of re-add site) if any of these
	  conditions are true:
	  1 - No re-add site input provided
	  2 - Re-add site input and/or CSV file input is provided but as a ${site-var} itself
	  3 - Re-add site input is provided but as a $<csv-var> but yields an empty value
	  4 - New workflow variable const_SITE_VAR_FORCE_INIT_SITE is set to true (by default it is false)
	- When calling a follow on workflow, the NBI call also specifies key wrkfl_deviceFamily and sets it to
	  the family type used by this workflow; this can facilitate the next workflow, e.g. Apply Config Template,
	  to set the correct family type, even if XIQ-SE does not yet have it set for the device
