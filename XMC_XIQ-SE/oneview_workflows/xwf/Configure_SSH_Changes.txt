Configure SSH

v11
	- First version shared
v12
	- Was not detecting iqAgent enabled; fixed
v14
	- Added delay before re-enabling SSH as the SNMP Set would sometimes fail
v40
	- Re-designed around updated SNMP functions which can now skip OID which
	  return "No Such Object" and also implements rollback; so now works even
	  on older VSPs, which might not have all the SSH MIBs nor iqAgent
v42 - posted
	- Re-added Key Exchange cypher diffie-hellman-group1-sha1, as this is still
	  configurable on older VOSS versions
	- Cyphers now have comments inline in the workflow inputs
	- Debug is now shown in case of snmpSet called with returnError=True
