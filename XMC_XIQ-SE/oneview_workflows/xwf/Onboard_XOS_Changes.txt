Onboard XOS

v1
	- First version based off Onboard VSP v171
v6
	- VLAN and I-SID input values now have leading zeros stripped if necessary
	- If input data is fed into variable wrkfl_deviceJsonData, the lookup index is extracted from the same data, under
	  key ["__LOOKUP__"], if present in the data; else it is obtianed from workflow inputs and NBI lookup as usual
	- If a key listed in variable const_EXPORT_EMC_VARS is found to not exist in emc_vars, now a warning message is
	  displayed, instead of failing the workflow. For some of the default keys ("deviceName","deviceSysOid","deviceType",
	  "family",..) this can happen if this workflow is called by one of the Onboard Mgmt VLAN/CLIP/etc.. workflows
	  right after these have re-added the device to XIQ-SE, and XIQ-SE has not had enough time to fully re-discover the
	  device and set those emc_vars keys. If this workflow is not actually using any of those keys as site variables in
	  the template file, it made no sense to fail the workflow. However, if those keys are used on workflow inputs
	  then the workflow will still fail when the variable needs to be replaced; in this case consider increasing the
	  const_FOLLOW_WORKFLOW_DELAY variable on the calling Onboard Mgmt VLAN/CLIP/etc.. workflow to give XIQ-SE enough
	  time to re-discover the device
	- Implemented retries on performing save config, as seems a save config can sometimes fail with
	  "Error: This command cannot be executed during configuration save."
v14 - posted
	- Added input for Message-Authenticator Attribute required/not-required
	- Added input to determine if the NAC Location Group should be created if not already existing
	- Added option to enable FA message authentication on access ports; with 33.5, this can also lock-in FA auth on the
	  FA server uplinks as well. Additionally a custom FA auth key can be set as well, but only on the access ports,
	  never the FA server uplink ports
	- Fixed bug in #elseif Cisco velocity type statement processing; the #elseif condition was never processed even if
	  the #elseif condition was true; this issue was introduced with nesting in v89
