Onboard VSP

v55
v57
v59
	- Auto-sense Data I-sid config now takes care of creating platform VLAN in activity 04
	- Auto-sense Data I-sid config performed in activity 05 if possible
	- Activity 05 now checks the software for a non-committed software, and commits if necessary before rebooting
	- Activity 05 now also deletes the auto-sense ISIS hello auth encrypted key file before reooting
	- Activity 01 now able to read site global custom variables, if a site-specific one does not exist
	- Activity 01 now handles null values from custom variables
v61
	- Activity 05 was not correctly matching uncommited software from pre8.2 to post8.2
v63
	- Activity 02 now also globally enables radius accounting on switch
v65
	- Activity 02, running on already configured switch, deletion of radius servers errors if accounting is enabled
	- Activity 02, accounting must be enabled after a delay from enabling radius servers
	- Activity 04, check prior existance of auto-sense voice & data i-sids and clear settings before setting again
	- Activity 04, a platform VLAN is now automatically allocated for untagged auto-sense voice i-sid on regular BEB
	- Activity 04, allocated platform VLANs for auto-sense data i-sid and untagged voice i-sid are named accordingly
v75
	- Activity 01, readSiteCustomVariables() v3; read variables up site parents
	- Activity 01 & 03 update nbi mutations with new nbiQuery() and nbiMutation() v2
	- Activity 01 ${vars} can now get used on the additional CLI script
	- Activities 02,04,05 disable more paging on VSP from start
	- Activity 02 added input to create RADIUS server for cli+web in addition to eapol
	- Activities 01,02 ability to handle RADIUS server creation/deletion also for cli & web 
	- Activity 02, increase sleep timer to 2 secs before enabling radius accounting
v77
	- Activity 01, validation of RADIUS secret, must not contain '?' and max 32 characters
	- Activity 02, configuration of RADIUS secret is now quoted (key can now contain spaces)
	- Activity 03, when adding switch to a NAC location group, it is added for Any interface
v79
	- Activities 02,04,05 config_term & end are now sent with sendCLI_configCommand()
	- Activity 04, was trying to create platform VLANs on DVR Leaf, if the workflow was re-executed on the same switch
	  a second time; this was obviuosly failing
	- Activity 05 changed order of commands appended to config.cfg; dvr leaf is now set first, otherwise the auto-sense
	  data i-sid and untagged voice i-sid commands fail to get set, dur to missing platform vlan
	- Activity 04, was not detecting an already set auto-sense data i-sid
	- Activity 02 increased sleep timer from 2 to 4sec, before activating RADIUS accounting
	- Activity 04 when both data i-sid and isis hello auth are set, now sets data i-sid after setting the isis hello auth
v81
	- Activity 04 was no longer detecting existing auto-sense voice i-sid with 8.4.2.x due to CLI output changes
	- Workflow inputs, additional CLI commands field, now has commented out example of Upnp ACL filter for DVR Leaf
v83
	- Activity 04; removed code which was globally shutting down ISIS when activating the ISIS Hello Auth key
	- Activity 02; increased sleep timer before enabling radius accounting from 4sec to 8sec
v85
	- Activity 02 disabling/enabling radius accounting command is now wrapped in a loop to retry up 10 times at 4 sec
	  delay, until the command succeeds without an error
	- Activity 05; additional 20sec delay before converting switch into DVR-Leaf mode
	- Added "Fabric Engine" as workflow supported Network OS together with existing VOSS
v91
	- Documented how to set a NAC Engine as Primary RADIUS server when configuring the switch
	- Added better versioning; now the workflow version is displayed in the output log of all activities
	- Added support for Auto-Sense WAP-Type1 I-SID/VLAN-id and Wait-Interval
	- Improved the workflow reported messages, at workflow level, activity level and device level, including errors
v97
	- Updated all function libraries
	- Added more combinations for RADIUS server use-by values
	- Added variable const_cliCmdsFailOnError to control whether workflow should fail on user CLI commands error
	- Added variable const_cliCmdsSkipOnError to control whether to skip rest of user CLI commands on error 
v99
	- MakeVspDvrLeaf_05; now attempts to enable DVR Leaf without doing a switch reboot
v100
	- MakeVspDvrLeaf_05; now deletes any non-default platform VLANs, which might have got added by ZTP+ onboarding
	  so as to be able to enter DVR Leaf mode without any switch reset
v101
	- Updated all functions; activity 4 can now use embedded directives #error and #block in the CLI commands
	- Activity 03 now adds the switch to Access Control with Auth Access Type = Manual RADIUS Configuration
	  previously it was incorrectly setting Auth Access Type = Network Access
	- ReadSiteInputs_01: Was failing if no Control Engines found in XIQ-SE, even if the NAC enable input was disabled
	- Activity 04 was incorrectly trying to create auto-sense platform VLANs when run against a DVR Leaf without
	  enabling the DVR Leaf input
v102
	- If configuring NAC on switch, globally enabling RADIUS now happens at the very end of the workflow, as otherwise
	  some RADIUS authentications could create dynamic VLANs on the switch even before the Custom CLI commands can get
	  executed to make those VLANs static. Also if setting RADIUS CLI authentication, this ensures the workflow can
	  complete without requiring any RADIUS CLI authentications for itself SSH-ing into the switch
v103
	- Activity 04 was failing to create auto-sense data/voice/wap platform VLAN, if another VLAN already existed on
	  the switch with the same name the activity was trying to set on the newly created VLAN; added logic to default
	  conflicting names and the activity can no longer fail when setting the VLAN name
v104
	- Activity 05 was failing to convert the switch to DVR Leaf if the switch already had a mgmt VLAN on a VLAN-id
	  other than the default 4048, because it was trying to delete that VLAN and failing
v105
	- Activity 04 was failing to configure the auto-sense FA auth key
v106
	- MakeVspDvrLeaf_05 when trying to delete non-default platform VLANs could fail to delete a VLAN if ZIQ-SE 23.4
	  or later ZTP+ created the VLAN as an auto-sense I-SID. The workflow would fail and not enable DVR Leaf on the
	  switch. Now the workflow will not fail, and will resort to activating DVR Leaf via a switch reboot.
v112
	- Added optional CSV file so $<csv-variable> in addition to ${site-custom-variable}
	- CSV variables also work in format $(csv-variable) as carets are not allowed in combo box inputs
	- Added activity 06 with ability to add switch to Policy Domain as well as Policy VLAN Island Topology
	- Activity 04 under additional CLI commands has commented out exemple of how to set EDM user passwords from there
	- Activity 04 additional CLI commands now only processes commands which are not commented out
	- Activity 04 additional CLI commands can now process commands with // to feed passwords to interactive prompts
	- Variable const_cliCmdsSkipOnError, for execution of optional CLI commands, now defaults to false
	- Activity 02 when configuring RADIUS on switch, will now always configure "radius reachability mode status-server"
	- Updated all functions
v113
	- Updated all functions (# CSV data input was buggy)
	- Was failing to load CSV variables, $<csv-variable>, due to missing workflow variable const_CSV_DELIMITER
	- AddToPolicy_06: Introduced a 5 secs sleep timer before enforcing the Policy Domain
v115
	- Workflow now has input for switch system-name to configure
v118
	- If NAC Engine Group configured with External Load Balancers, now configures Load Balancer IPs as RADIUS server
	  on the switch instead of actual NAC Engine IPs
	- Added ability to execute a follow on workflow 
v126 - posted
	- Fixed issue with follow-on workflow which was not working at all
	- Changed the logic used with NAC External Load Balancers; if these are found to be set, the switches are configured
	  with the load balancer IPs as RADIUS servers, but the dynamic RADIUS client entries are still configured using the 
	  actual NAC engine IPs
	- If, with load balancers with NAC, we have more than 2 NAC engine IPs to configure as dynamic RADIUS clients,
	  error checking is disabled after configuring the 1st two dynamic RADIUS clients; this is because VOSS today can
	  only configure at most 2 dynamic clients, but newer versions will support more; hence making the workflow future
	  proof now
	- As only two dynamic RADIUS clients might be configurable on VOSS, there is a way to ensure that the NAC Engines
	  associated with the primary NAC Load Balancer are the first to be configured; to achieve this, add the Load Balancer
	  to XIQ-SE and under Device Annotation, set UserData#1 to "Primary" and UserData#2 to "Pool = <1st IP>, <2nd IP>"
