v79
	- Activities 02,04,05 config_term & end are now sent with sendCLI_configCommand()
	- Activity 04, was trying to create platform VLANs on DVR Leaf, if the workflow was re-executed on the same switch
	  a second time; this was obviuosly failing
	- Activity 05 changed order of commands appended to config.cfg; dvr leaf is now set first, otherwise the auto-sense
	  data i-sid and untagged voice i-sid commands fail to get set, dur to missing platform vlan
	- Activity 04, was not detecting an already set auto-sense data i-sid

v99
	- MakeVspDvrLeaf_05; now attempts to enable DVR Leaf without doing a switch reboot
v100 - posted
	- MakeVspDvrLeaf_05; now deletes any non-default platform VLANs, which might have got added by ZTP+ onboarding
