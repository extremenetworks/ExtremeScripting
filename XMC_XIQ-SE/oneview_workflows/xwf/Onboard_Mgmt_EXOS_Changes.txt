Onboard Mgmt EXOS

v3
	- First version shared; forked from Onboard Mgmt VLAN v92
v13
	- Lots of bug fixes!
v15
	- Added logic to change the IP address on the same existing mgmt VLAN
	- Also added logic for replicing the untagged VLAN on optional UNI static port
v16
	- Implemented const_NO_ERROR_ON_FAIL_SAVE
v22
	- Setting a UNI access port input is now mutually exclusive with setting a VLAN I-SID
	- After setting the VLAN I-SID, workflow now waits for that binding to be active before proceeding
v29
	- Error messages in case of NBI mutations now display LastNbiError
	- Creation of new mgmt VLAN IP, Gateway and removal of existing mgmt IP and gateway are now done
	  via TFTP script
	- Added variable const_EXPORT_EMC_VARS which can be populated with emc_vars keys to make available
	  in ${<varname>} variables, with special treatment of keys "deviceIP" & "deviceName" which will be
	  set to the target VLAN mgmt IP and System name; these variables can be used in the Additional
	  CLI commands input box
	- FA Message Authentication input combo now has variable inputs
	- On EXOS switches which do not support mirror from auto-source-ip, the app-telemetry EAN ERSPAN
	  mirror is deleted and re-created using the new mgmt VLAN IP as from IP
	- Sometimes emc_vars['deviceSoftwareVer'] is not available after ZTP+ onboarding; workflow now
	  gets version from switch directly if that happens instead of failing
v37
	- Summary of executed commands no longer includes the TFTP file transfer, cat and execution
	- Added variable const_FOLLOW_WORKFLOW_DELAY to be able to add a delay before calling follow on
	  workflow
	- Workflow was failing in Sanity mode waiting for FA I-SID to become active
v38
	- Message printing delay to execute follow on workflow was printing the wrong timer
v42
	- CSV parsing code is now forgiving with invalid CSV files where an entry has less records than declared in the top row
	- Added support for path variables %rootDir%, %sitePath% and %siteName% on CSV file input
	- Ability to parse #if/#elseif/#else/#end, #eval, #sleep, #last statements in additional CLI commands input
	- Timer const_DELAY_RECONNECT increased from 10 to 15sec
v43
	- Changed workflow so that it can take the data for the $<variables> not from a CSV file but directly from
	  either another activity added to the workflow, or by calling this workflow via NBI call. In both cases
	  the new workflow variable wrkfl_deviceJsonData just needs to be set in JSON format to the equivalent data
	  that is extracted from the CSV file; this is so that some customers can hook up the workflow directly with
	  their IPAM database instead of using a CSV file.
	- Python within activities is now versioned, since people are taking the Python code and using it within their
	  own, different workflows
	- Python within activities are now able to set their own const_xxx variables to defaults even if those variables
	  are not defined under workflow variables; for same reason, people are taking the Python code and using it within
	  their own, different workflows which may not have those variables set
	- CLI functions enhances so that failure to connect at first attempt no longer makes the entire workflow fail.
	  Now the CLI will retry by default 6 times at 10 sec intervals; so will only fail if no CLI connection can be
	  established after 1min and 10sec. Defaults can be changed with variables const_CLI_RETRIES and const_CLI_RETRY_DELAY
	- As of XIQ-SE 25.2, when deleting a switch from the database, XIQ-SE wants to connect to the switch to withdraw
	  the Pilot license, but if the switch is unreachable, then the delete process takes 5 minutes. The old logic
	  of this workflow was to change the mgmt IP on the switch, then delete the switch with its old IP from the site
	  and then re-add the same switch with the new IP. But this means that when the switch is being deleted, it is no
	  longer reachable by XIQ-SE. The new workflow logic is to first delete the switch from XIQ-SE + now wait for that
	  to complete, only then the mgmt IP on the switch is changed (as well as setting ISIS Auth key if applicable) and
	  then we wait for that IP to be reachable. If the IP is not reachable, then the switch is re-added to XIQ-SE
	  with its old IP (as the mgmt convert will rollback anyway) and the workflow aborts. Whereas if the new mgmt IP
	  is reachable, then the existing CLI session (on no longer existing IP) is closed; the workflow then proceeds
	  to delete the old IP from Access Control and all and any Access Control Location Groups, and after the site
	  re-add delay finally re-adds the switch with its new mgmt IP into XIQ-SE, in the same or desired site.
	  CLI connection is the re-established with the new mgmt IP, and the new mgmt IP is committed (so that it won't
	  rollback), if app-telemetry was configured, the sflow source IP is changed, and the rest of the custom CLI
	  commands is applied.
	- New variable 	const_WAIT_TIME_SITE_DELETE at default 120 sec, is max time to wait for device deletion from
	  XIQ-SE to complete
	- CSV data (file and index) can now be exported to follow on workflow
v44
	- const_WAIT_TIME_SITE_DELETE increased from 120 to 360 secs, as device deletion might take that long with
	  XIQ-SE 25.2 if the device in not reachable for any reason
	- In case of failure, if a Site to re-add was given, the workflows was re-adding there, instead of rolling back
	  to the original site
v48/1.03
	- Changing mgmt IP on existing VLAN is not possible; the CLI session is lost once the existing IP is deleted;
	  EXOS does not have a "mgmt convert" command...; added a check to bomb out from workflow if the requested
	  mgmt VLAN id is the same as the existing mgmt VLAN id
	- Was failing on X435 because "show process tftpd" gives error
v50/1.04
	- CSV data exported to follow on workflow is now exported as JSON using launch variable wrkfl_deviceJsonData
	- If a different site to re-add device to is given, this site is now used to resolve ${site-variables}
	- Added to variable const_EXPORT_EMC_VARS additional emc_vars key deviceNosId
v51/1.05
	- Regex was failing to scrape VLAN IP and mask from "show vlan" if the IP address had 3 digits for all 4 bytes
v52/1.06
	- CSV now also extracts the device's lookup (serial number or MAC address) to be used as $<> variable
v54/1.08
	- Added more logic to v50 change: if a different site to re-add device to is given, this site is now used
	  to resolve ${site-variables}
	  But, the initial site of the switch is still going to be used (instead of re-add site) if any of these
	  conditions are true:
	  1 - No re-add site input provided
	  2 - Re-add site input and/or CSV file input is provided but as a ${site-var} itself
	  3 - Re-add site input is provided but as a $<csv-var> but yields an empty value
	  4 - New workflow variable const_SITE_VAR_FORCE_INIT_SITE is set to true (by default it is false)
	- When calling a follow on workflow, the NBI call also specifies key wrkfl_deviceFamily and sets it to
	  the family type used by this workflow; this can facilitate the next workflow, e.g. Apply Config Template,
	  to set the correct family type, even if XIQ-SE does not yet have it set for the device
	- If the switch uplinks are connected to FA Server(s) and those FA Servers are advertizing an untagged FA Mgmt
	  VLAN (vid=4095) then on completion of the IP migration, default untagged VLAN 1 will be removed from those
	  uplinks
v55/1.10 - posted
	- Mgmt VLAN I-SID input was supposed to be optional, but the workflow failed if no I-SID was provided
	- Was not detecting application-telemetry mirror config using source IP = "Auto source IP"
	- Fixed bug in #elseif Cisco velocity type statement processing; the #elseif condition was never processed even if
	  the #elseif condition was true; this issue was introduced with nesting in v89
