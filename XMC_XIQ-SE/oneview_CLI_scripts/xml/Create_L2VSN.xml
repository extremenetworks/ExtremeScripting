# XMC Script: Create L2VSN (for device context menu)     #
# Written by Ludovico Stevens, CSE Extreme Networks      #
##########################################################
# Create a L2VSN across any of VOSS, EXOS, BOSS
# Written by Ludovico Stevens, CSE Extreme Networks

__version__ = '2.6'

# 1.5 - Changed CLI dict 'get_isid_uni_data' so that it can work on VSP8600 also (no CLI grep)
#     - Creating a service with no ports and no vlan was giving an error about tagging mode
#     - Was failing if ERS switch was not configured with vlan configcontrol automatic
#     - Updated libraries
#     - If the XOS already had a dynamic VLAN script was failing to convert that VLAN to static
#     - XOS has changed some CLI commands; modifications to be able to specify 2 or more syntaxes
#     - If input MLT ids provided would try and flex-uni enable all MLTs on switch
# 1.6 - Updated with latest functions for use on universal hardware
# 1.7 - Added Universal Platform Fabric/Switch Engine in FamilyChildren (Dda)
# 1.8 - Improved VOSS logic to detect if selected ports are using Switched-UNI or CVLAN-UNI
#       but script only works if all ports (MLTs) selected are consistent; cannot currently
#       have some ports (MLTs) using CVLAN UNI and others using Switch-UNI
# 1.9 - Create I-SID now will work even if y/n confirmation prompt
# 2.0 - Updated all function libraries
#     - For VOSS implemented this logic:
        # Input Ports | DVR Leaf | Auto-Sense | Flex-uni   | Type to create
        #    yes      |   yes    | don't care | don't care | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
        #    yes      |   no     |    yes     | don't care | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI
        #    yes      |   no     |    no      |    yes     | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
        #    yes      |   no     |    no      |    no      | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI
        #    no       |   yes    |    no      |    no      | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
        #    no       |   no     |    no      |    no      | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI
#
#     - Script can now configure both flex-uni and cvlan uni ports in the same run on VOSS
#     - Auto-sense is now checked, and disabled, before applying VLAN/binding on port
#     - The service name (VLAN name) is now also assigned to the I-SID name on VOSS
#     - After VSN creation, script now triggers device rediscovery and config reload via XIQ-SE
#       api (latter requires XIQ-SE version 23.2 or later).
# 2.1 - Fixed issue where creating a Switched-UNI on an auto-sense enabled port was failing because
#       when you disable auto-sense it has the effect of disabling flex-uni on the port
# 2.2 - Interim fix by Didier to allow subports in generatePortRange function
# 2.3 - Updated port processing functions to support channelized ports (slot/port/chan)
# 2.4 - Change to port processing functions to support channelized ports had broken regualar port
#       and slot/port list and range processing
# 2.5 - I-SID name is now only configured if a VLAN name was provided
#       Added input for user to express preference for using CVLAN-UNI or Switched-UNI on VOSS
# 2.6 - Enabling flex-UNI was hapening twice for auto-sense ports with nothing connected state
#     - Logic updated:
        # Table to determine type of L2VSN we need to create
        # Input Ports | DVR Leaf | Auto-Sense | Pref Input | Flex-uni   | Type to create
        #    yes      |   yes    | don't care | don't care | don't care | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
        #    yes      |   no     |    yes     |  none      | don't care | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI
        #    yes      |   no     |    yes     |  Flex-UNI  | don't care | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
        #    yes      |   no     |    yes     |  CVLAN-UNI | don't care | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI
        #    yes      |   no     |    no      | don't care |    yes     | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
        #    yes      |   no     |    no      | don't care |    no      | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI
        #    no       |   yes    |    no      | don't care |    n/a     | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
        #    no       |   no     |    no      |  none      |    n/a     | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI
        #    no       |   no     |    no      |  Flex-UNI  |    n/a     | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
        #    no       |   no     |    no      |  CVLAN-UNI |    n/a     | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI

# 
# This script provisions a L2VSN between any Fabric Connect or Fabric Attach switch
# It works across all of VOSS VSPs (including in DVR Leaf mode), BOSS ERS and EXOS
#
# An I-SID must be provided.
#
# A service name can optionally be entered; if provided this will be assigned as VLAN
# name on CVLAN UNIs and will also set the I-SID name on VOSS.
#
# The VLAN-id must normally be provided as well, either at the global level or at the
# device level (when a value is provided at both global and device level, the device
# level value will be used). The exception is when creating an untagged Switched-UNI
# service, in which case no VLAN-id value is required and any value provided will be
# ignored.
#
# The Port list is optional. If provided, the service will be terminated on the ports.
# Port syntax follows the same syntax you would use on the switch; comma separated
# lists of ports or ranges are allowed; range syntaxes are 1/1-1/5 on a VSP, 1/1-5 on
# an ERS and 1:1-5 or 1:* on an XOS. Port ranges spanning slots (e.g. 1/1-2/24 or
# 1:1-2:24) are currently not supported.
# The MLT id list is also optional. This will only work on VSPs and the script will
# expect to find the MLTs already created on the switch (i.e. this script will not
# create the MLTs, just configure a L2VSN end-point on them) and to already have the 
# correct/requested tagging mode.
# If no Port list or MLT list is provided, the service will be created on the switch,
# globally but on no interfaces (this can be required when configuring a L2VSN on an
# SMLT-BEB pair, where the end-point is single attached to only one of the VSPs
# SMLT-BEBs; the other SMLT-BEB will need to have the same service termination or it
# will not work properly)
#
# If the device is a VSP which, the logic for creating either a CVLAN-UNI or a
# Switched-UNI is the following:
#
#    DVR Leaf | Auto-Sense | Flex-uni   | Type to create
#      yes    | don't care | don't care | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
#      no     |    yes     | don't care | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI
#      no     |    no      |    yes     | =&gt; create Switched-UNI
#      no     |    no      |    no      | =&gt; create CVLAN-UNI
#
# If instead the device is an ERS or an XOS or an older VSP (not capable of supporting
# Flex-uni), then this script will provision a CVLAN-uni based service.
