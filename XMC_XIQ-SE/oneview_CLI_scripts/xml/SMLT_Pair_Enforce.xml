# Written by Ludovico Stevens, CSE Extreme Networks      #
##########################################################
# Does VSP SMLT Clustering in Fabric Connect

__version__ = '2.8'

# 1.0 - Initial
# 1.2 - When deleting an LACP LAG MLT, the underlying ports now are restored tu untagged
#       config, so that a new config of them finds them unused
# 1.3 - Small fix for 8.3 autosense ports
# 2.0 - Redesigned the inputs and able to enforce vIST creation even if connecting inband
#     - GRT route-map for suppressing IST IP subnet is now always created, even if no redistribution yet on switches
#     - Script now disables auto-sense in order to create SMLTs
#     - Script now expects both VSPs to have a nickname assigned
#     - Script automatically converts auto-sense NNIs between the two peer switches to static NNIs
#       and if multiple auto-sense NNIs are found between peers (with same speed) then an MLT NNI is created
# 2.1 - Acknowledge input was not properly considered when operating inband
# 2.2 - On rollback when removing flex-uni, the ports were not defaulted for tagging, and at next run port would be refused
#     - Updated all functions
# 2.3 - IST route map now detect the IST subnet + mask and sets the mask correctly (not hard coded to 30bits)
# 2.4 - Previous fix was causing the IST prefix list creation to fail when creating the IST; now handled correctly
# 2.5 - Updated threads library to work with usernames including "."
# 2.6 - On completion workflow now triggers device config reload via XIQ-SE API
# 2.7 - Rollback was incorrectly trying to default dot1q encap on MLT interface
#     - SLPP-Guard is now automatically disabled before trying to enable SLPP packet-rx
# 2.8 - Fabric Attach Management VLAN:ISID input now allows only an I-SID number to be provided, for untagged use


# todo:
# - for delete/remove, need to detect if MLT is flex and has bindings, either error or automatically remove all the bindings
# - option to use VLACP/LACP on ERS/XOS FA links

# 
# This script provisions and enforces SMLT vIST clustering on VSP devices including if
# these are operating in DVR Leaf mode.
# It must be run against a pair (or multiple pairs) of VSP switches. 
# It requires the VSP switches to be already configured for Fabric Connect and can be
# used to perform and update all of the following:
# - Creation or deletion of vIST SMLT Clustering
# - Addition of new, or removal of existing, MLT/SMLT interfaces
#
# There are several use cases for this script:
# (1) - Provision SMLT Clustering on a pair (or muliple pairs) of VSPs
# (2) - Provision up to 5 SMLT/MLT interfaces on one or more VSP SMLT Cluster pairs
#       this can be combined with (1)
# (3) - Removal of one or more SMLT interfaces from one or more VSP SMLT Cluster pairs
# (4) - Complete removal of SMLT Clustering and all SMLT interfaces from one or more
#       VSP SMLT Cluster pairs
#
# The following global input can be provided by the user:
#
# - Global Enforce Action: vIST pair enforce for (1),(2)&amp;(3) above; vIST delete for (4)
# If it is desired to simply SMLT Cluster VSP switch pairs together and not create any
# SMLT interfaces, the Enforce action can be set and the script can be run immediately.
# Likewise, if it desired to completely delete SMLT clustering from the selected VSPs
# then the vIST delete action can be set and the script can be run immediately.
#
# - Acknowledge pulldown: This script is able to create/delete the vIST even if the
# VSP is managed and accessed inband, in spite of having to globally shutdown ISIS
# to make the necessary config changes, and then re-enable ISIS. However the switch
# will temporarly stop forwarding traffic during the change, so this configuration
# should not be done while in production. If the switch is managed inband and the
# acknowledge pull down was not set, then the script will take no action.
#
# If instead it is desired to create new SMLT interfaces, or delete existing ones, then
# the optional SMLT interface user inputs will need to be populated accordingly.
#
# SMLT Deletion :
# - List or range of MLT ids to delete: Provide MLT ids to delete. Note that SMLTs
#                                       using the same ports cannot be deleted and
#                                       created (with below inputs) in the same run
#
# SMLT Creation (maximum of 5 SMLTs can be created per run):
# - SMLT MLT type: Select the type of MLT to create:
#                  - Static
#                  - Static + VLACP
#                  - LACP LAG
# - SMLT MLT I-SID/VLAN binding mode: Select the desired binding mode:
#                 - Manual untagged
#                 - Manual dot1q-tagged
#                 - Manual Switched-UNI
#                 - Fabric Attach
#                 - Fabric Attach with no message authentication
#                 - Endpoint-Tracking
# - Fabric Attach Management VLAN:ISID: This field is only relevant if the previous
#                 MLT I-SID/VLAN binding mode selected was one of the Fabric Attach modes.
#                 In this case an FA management VLAN:ISID can be provided for the FA
#                 configuration of the SMLT. Otherwise leave this field empty.
#                 The VLAN value can be omitted, if an untagged FA binding is preferred
# - SMLT 1-5 id:name: Use these optional fields to set the id or name or both id+name for
#                     the new SMLTs. If no id is provided, the script will automatically
#                     allocate MLT ids
# - SMLT 1-5 port(s): Use this table to assign the SMLT port numbers on the selected
#                     switches. One or more ports can be provided
#
# Once user input has been provided, the script does the following.
#
# The selected VSP switches are inspected to ensure that they are running ISIS and SPB
# and that they are members of a Fabric (i.e. they have some ISIS adjacencies). If not,
# the script will error and invite the user to Fabric enable the VSPs beforehand.
# DVR and any existing Virtual-IST configuration is also inspected.
# If the action is Enforce and no vIST config exist (meaning that this script will need
# to configure vIST) additional data is extracted from the switch: chassis MAC, VSP
# LLDP neighbours, already used VLAN-ids etc..
# If the action is Enforce and some SMLT MLTs are to be created, existing MLT config is
# also examined.
# The various data collected is then shared across other instances of the same script
# running against other VSPs. This data then allows on the one hand to be able to pair
# up VSPs which already form, or will form, an SMLT Cluster pair, and on the other hand
# will provide the necessary data to configure vIST across the VSP pairs (e.g.
# smlt-peer-bmac).
# If the VSP is already vIST configured, the script makes sure that there is another
# instance of the same script running on the vIST peer VSP as well. If not the script
# will terminate with an error.
# If instead the VSP has no prior vIST configuration then the script needs to be able
# pair the VSP with another VSP in order to configure SMLT clustering on both. The
# simplest case is where the user only executed the script against only two VSPs, the
# ones which are to be SMLT Clustered. Some compatibility tests are made (e.g. DVR Leaf
# can only be paired with another DVR Leaf). If more than two VSPs were selected when
# the script was executed, then the script tries to pair the VSPs accordingly, based
# on which VSPs are LLDP neighbours, which ones are DVR Leaf nodes or not, etc..
# If at this stage a selected VSP cannot be paired with another VSP running another
# instance of the same script, or no suitable pair can be deteremined, the script
# will terminate with an error.
#
# For SMLT Creation all the following parameters and identifiers are auto-generated:
# - Smlt-Virt-Bmac: Only set if VSPs have manually configured ISIS System Ids; if
#                   auto-generated will typically use the bmac of primary node + 1;
#                   any bmac selected is checked to make sure it does not already
#                   exist, and all possible bmacs with 1st 5 bytes of Primary node
#                   will be checked.
# - DVR Leaf Cluster id: Will use the last 9bits of Primary VSP Nickname
# - IST VLAN: First available VLAN id in range 4050-4000 will be allocated
# - IST I-SID: Will be 15000000 + last 19bits of Primary VSP Nickname
# - IST IP : Will use IP subnet 192.168.255.X/30 where X is the last 6bits of
#            Secondary VSP nickname; Primary VSP will allocate IP#1 and Secondary VSP
#            will allocate IP#2
