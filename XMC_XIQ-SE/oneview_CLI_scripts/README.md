## Prompt handling
Some devices do answer with unexpected prompt. For such devices you can create `appdata/scripting/myCLIRules.xml` (no reboot is required). The myCLIRules.xml "Rule name" must match the Vendor Profiles -> CLI Rules File Name variable. Vendor Profiles are inherited, you can configure the variable for whole family.

| Device        | myCLIRules.xml | CLI Rules File Name |

|HPE Comware/H3C|[myCLIRules.xml](xml/comware/myCLIRules.xml?raw=true)|[comware](xml/comware/VendorProfilesComware.png?raw=true)|


# XIQ Site Engine and Extreme Management Center version 8.0+ Scripts
## XMC scripts
| OS | Script name   | Description   | Type   |
| -- | ------------- | ------------- |:------:|
| n/a |[Retrieve Script Log](xml/Retrieve_Script_Log.xml?raw=true)| This script does for XMC scripts what Workflow Dashboard does for workflows. Once the script window is closed, it is hard to go back and see the script output (one has to go and look to XMC's Linux file system). To find a past script log, simply run this script against the switch (or switches) where the seeked script was previously executed. If no inputs are provided the script will list all script logs which were executed against the same switch IP, together with the relative timestamp. Once spotted the desired log, simply hit Back, enter the script name and timestamp and run again. If only 1 matching script log is found, then the script log is dumped in the script window. If no sript logs are found then this script intentionally raises an exception so as to get a red cross next to the device indicating no hit|Python|
| n/a |[CLI Custom Action script](xml/CLI_Custom_Action_script.xml?raw=true)| A simple CLI script cannot be assigned to Site Actions tab Custom Actions table. This Python script allows a simple list of CLI commands, provided at the very beginning of this script file, to be executed, and this script can be assigned to Site Actions tab Custom Actions table because it is a Python script. Optionally a flag can be set (True or False) to determine what to do if a command produces an error on the switch. If set to False, all remaining commands will be sent anyway; if set to True, then remaining commands will not be sent. The CLI script can include references to site custom variables using syntax ${<site-custom-variable>}. The site of the selected switch will apply. If a variable is not found in the site of the switch, then the variable is looked up in the parent sites all the way up to /World. If it is not found in any of the parent sites then the global version of the variable will be used; and if the variable is not found anywhere then the script will error|Python|
## EXOS scripts
| OS | Script name   | Description   | Type   |

| EXOS |[Create EAPS protected VLAN](xml/Create_EAPS_protected_VLAN.xml?raw=true)|Add vlan to the EAPS as protected. If the vlan does not exits then it creates it. Selected ports are added as tagged or untagged. If there is only one EAPS ring then you do not need to specify the EAPS ring name. Ring ports are added as tagged automatically.|TCL|

| VOSS |[Move to CLIP Mgmt IP](xml/Move_to_CLIP_Mgmt_IP.xml?raw=true)| Given a switch already in XMC, this script will ask user to provide a CLIP IP and VRF which will then be configured as mgmt clip on the VSP. If the VSP already had a mgmt clip the existing mgmt clip will be deleted and replaced with the new one. If the switch had a mgmt vlan IP, this can also be deleted, based on script input. At the same time, the switch can be renamed, both under SNMP and ISIS. Finally the switch is deleted from XMC's database as well as XMC Control if there, and re-added to the same site with the new mgmt IP address. Before attempting to change the IP on the switch, the script will first of all make sure that the new IP address provided is not already known by XMC and that it does not exist on the network (does not reply to ping). v1.9|Python|
