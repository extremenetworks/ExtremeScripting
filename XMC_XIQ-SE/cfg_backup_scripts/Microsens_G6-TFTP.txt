-- When logging in, CLI asks -> Press any key to continue
--    so need to have a return as the first line of the script.
-- When logging out, 
-- the y answers the question -> Do you want to log out [y/n]?
-- the n answers the question -> Do you want to save current configuration [y/n]?    
-- (this second question doesn't always show, so it is left out for now.  Otherwise an error occurs when it is sent because the session is closed.)
